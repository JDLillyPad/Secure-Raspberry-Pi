# Secure Raspberry Pi

## Objective

The Secure Raspberry Pi project aimed to install the Raspberry Pi OS Lite software on a Raspberry Pi 5 and to harden it, in the process we will learn Linux fundamentals, system hardening, authentication, and service management. Next we can use the Raspberry Pi to do network discovery and scanning with nmap, arp-scan, and netdiscover to map a home network. We can automate these tasks by running a simple script. 

### Skills Learned

- System hardening, authentication, service management
- Reconnaissance, IP ranges, automation basics.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- ufw & fail2ban
- nmap, arp-scan and netdiscover

## Steps
1. Purchase a Raspberry Pi

Today I received my Raspberry Pi 5 Starter Kit in the mail. The starter kit was purchased from Vilros and consists of the following:
 - two micro-HDMI to standard HDMI cable
 -  a class 10 128 GB Micro SD Memory Card
 -   Micro SD to USB Adapter/Reader
 -   Pi 5 Multi-Use Case w/ built-in Passive & Active cooling
 -   8GB RAM Raspberry Pi 5
 -   USB -C Raspberry Pi 5 Compaticle Power Supply
 -   Mini to Standard Camera Module Adapter Cable
 -   Raspberry Pi Case

My plan is to set up this Raspberry Pi as a headless computer, accessible only on the network. So, to set it up headless I don't need any additional peripherals and I only need to preconfigure a hostname, user account, network connection, and SSH when I install an operating system. NOTE: A Raspberry Pi will automatically boot from a microSD card when the slot contains a card. 

2. Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite onto my MicroSD Card

Every screenshot should have some text explaining what the screenshot is about.

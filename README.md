# Secure Raspberry Pi

## Objective

The Secure Raspberry Pi project aimed to install the Raspberry Pi OS Lite software on a Raspberry Pi 5 and to harden it, in the process we will learn Linux fundamentals, system hardening, authentication, and service management. Next we can use the Raspberry Pi to do network discovery and scanning with nmap, arp-scan, and netdiscover to map a home network. We can automate these tasks by running a simple script. 

### Skills Learned

- System hardening, authentication, service management
- Reconnaissance, IP ranges, automation basics.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- ufw & fail2ban
- nmap, arp-scan and netdiscover
